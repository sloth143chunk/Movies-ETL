# Movies-ETL

## Project Overview

For this project, I created an automated pipeline that takes in new data on movies, performs the appropriate transformations and loads the data into existing tables.

I created a function that takes in three files -- Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and a MovieLens rating data -- and performed an ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
