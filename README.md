# Movies-ETL

## Project Overview

For this project, I created an automated pipeline that takes in new data on movies, performs the appropriate transformations and uploads the data into existing tables.

A function that takes in three files -- Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and a MovieLens rating data -- and performs an ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

- Data Source: movies_metadata.csv, ratings.csv, wikipedia-movies.json
